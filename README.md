## � **Quick Troubleshooting Guide**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **1. Parsing Failures**
**Symptoms**: "Found X job items but parsed 0 jobs"
```bash
# Diagnosis: Check HTML structure changes
head -n 200 data/raw_backup/it_p1_*.html | grep "job-item-2"

# Solution: Test parser directly
python -c "
from src.crawler.parser import TopCVParser
parser = TopCVParser()
result = parser.parse_html_file('data/raw_backup/it_p1_*.html')
print(f'Parsed {len(result)} jobs')
"
```

#### **2. Anti-Detection Issues**
**Symptoms**: Captcha detection, blocked requests
```bash
# Diagnosis: Check logs for captcha detection
grep "captcha\|blocked" logs/processing.log

# Solution: Adjust delays and user-agent rotation
# Edit .env file:
CRAWLER_MIN_DELAY=5
CRAWLER_MAX_DELAY=10
```

#### **3. Database Connection Problems**
**Symptoms**: Connection refused, timeout errors
```bash
# Diagnosis: Check PostgreSQL status
docker ps | grep postgres

# Solution: Verify environment variables
python -c "
from src.utils.db import get_connection
try:
    with get_connection() as conn:
        print('✅ Database connection successful')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'❌ Database connection failed: {e}')
"
```

#### **4. Memory Issues**
**Symptoms**: Growing memory usage, slow performance
```bash
# Diagnosis: Check memory usage
ps aux | grep python | grep crawler

# Solution: Verify cleanup is working
grep "cleanup_processed_ids" logs/processing.log
```

#### **5. Circuit Breaker Triggers**
**Symptoms**: "Circuit Breaker triggered" messages
```bash
# Diagnosis: Check failure patterns
grep "Circuit Breaker" logs/processing.log

# Solution: Reduce concurrent processing
# Edit .env file:
CONCURRENT_BACKUPS=2
CRAWLER_NUM_PAGES=3
```
